This repository is for the C Binary Trees project that was done at the ALX Software Engineering School. While doing this project, I learnt:
- what a binary tree is
- the differences between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- what the possible gain in terms of time complexity is compared to linked lists
- what the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree are
- what the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree are
- what a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree is
